JAVA is an object oriented programming language.
JAVA is a strongly typed , case sensitive programming language.

class:class is a blueprint of an object.Example: vehicle is a blueprint or template of a car.

object:object is an instance of a class. (IS-A) example: car can be an instance or example of a vehicle/ car IS-A vehicle.

variable /fields:is a temporary storage in the heap. (variable is actually pot.)
we store  properties of an object in a variable.

there are two types of variable:( can be private/public......etc)
1-primitive    2- reference
long
short
int
double
boolean
float
String is not a pure primitive... but we treat it as one.

method: A Java method is a collection of statements that are grouped together to perform an operation/action/function.
can be public/private/protected.(we must call the method.)
1- public static void main ( String[] args){}.
2- [public] [void][method name](); ( it will not give us any return value)

3- [public] [int][method name] ( it will give us return value)
            [double]
            [long]
            [short]
            [String]
            [boolean]

constructor:
to initialize the object.(we dont need to call the method.) in constructor there is no return type.consturctor name=class name.

an application might have normal methods or not.
but an application must have a main method to run the application.
without main method it will not print anything to the console.
