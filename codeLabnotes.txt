codeLab notes:
in order to create constants we have to write "final" keyword.

declaring a variable : int a;
intitializing a variable int a =12;

what is casting expression in java?
Casting is essentially converting one data type to another, such as: 
double d = 4.0;
int c = d; //will give an error

Whereas code like this:
double d = 4.0;
int c = (int)d; //no error, 4 assigned to c

because you told Java you know you may lose precision 
(if d was equal to 4.9, c would still equal 4) but that you wish to simply 
truncate the other value, Java is happy to cast the double to an int.
